Analysis on Pewlett-Hackard Employee data

## Overview

The goal behind the analysis of Pewlett Hackard data was to help the management to plan and develop a strategy to identify employees who were to retire in the near future and the impact it would cause to the departments they belong to. The analysis performed will help the managment in making critical decisions like a few mentioned below :

      * How many new employees would need to be hired by department
      * By when should the hiring process be complete in order to ensure smooth transtion of roles and responsibilities
      * How many of the retiring employees could serve as consultants or mentors for the new hires
      * Funds to be allocated to the retirement packages based on number of employees retiring
            
## Results of the Analysis

      * There are a total of 90,398 employees who were born between 1952 to 1955 who are set to retire shortly 
      * The Engineers comprising of Sr. Engineers,Assistant Engineers and Engineers contribute to aprox. 50% of the retiring workforce
      * There are no mentors available with Manager title. This could be a problem since the company will have to hire atleast 2 Managers to replace the ones who are retiring           and these new hires may not have a mentor with the same title for a smooth transition      
      * Based on the current list of employees, there are 1549 employees who have birth dates in 1965 who are eligible to become mentors for the new hires
      * The average age of an employee at Pewlett-Hackard is 62 years
      
## Summary

      * Over 50% of the retiring employees were from the Development and Production 
      * In order to maintain the current gender ratio, the hiring team will need to consider the number of male vs female employees retiring. This will need to be a key factor 
        in the hiring process to maintain gender balance
      * Across all departments, it appears that less than 1% of the current employees are eligible to become mentors.On an average, for every 140 employees,there is 1 mentor
